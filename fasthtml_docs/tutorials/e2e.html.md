# JS App Walkthrough


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Installation

You‚Äôll need the following software to complete the tutorial, read on for
specific installation instructions:

1.  Python
2.  A Python package manager such as pip (which normally comes with
    Python) or uv
3.  FastHTML
4.  Web browser
5.  Railway.app account

If you haven‚Äôt worked with Python before, we recommend getting started
with [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

Note that you will only need to follow the steps in the installation
section once per environment. If you create a new repo, you won‚Äôt need
to redo these.

### Install FastHTML

For Mac, Windows and Linux, enter:

``` sh
pip install python-fasthtml
```

## First steps

By the end of this section you‚Äôll have your own FastHTML website with
tests deployed to railway.app.

### Create a hello world

Create a new folder to organize all the files for your project. Inside
this folder, create a file called `main.py` and add the following code
to it:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *

app = FastHTML()
rt = app.route

@rt('/')
def get():
    return 'Hello, world!'

serve()
```

</div>

Finally, run `python main.py` in your terminal and open your browser to
the ‚ÄòLink‚Äô that appears.

### QuickDraw: A FastHTML Adventure üé®‚ú®

The end result of this tutorial will be QuickDraw, a real-time
collaborative drawing app using FastHTML. Here is what the final site
will look like:

<figure>
<img src="imgs/quickdraw.png" alt="QuickDraw" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">QuickDraw</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Drawing Rooms

Drawing rooms are the core concept of our application. Each room
represents a separate drawing space where a user can let their inner
Picasso shine. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown:

1.  Room Creation and Storage

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
db = database('data/drawapp.db')
rooms = db.t.rooms
if rooms not in db.t:
    rooms.create(id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id')
Room = rooms.dataclass()

@patch
def __ft__(self:Room):
    return Li(A(self.name, href=f"/rooms/{self.id}"))
```

</div>

Or you can use our
[`fast_app`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/fastapp.html#fast_app)
function to create a FastHTML app with a SQLite database and dataclass
in one line:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
def render(room):
    return Li(A(room.name, href=f"/rooms/{room.id}"))

app,rt,rooms,Room = fast_app('data/drawapp.db', render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id')
```

</div>

We are specifying a render function to convert our dataclass into HTML,
which is the same as extending the `__ft__` method from the `patch`
decorator we used before. We will use this method for the rest of the
tutorial since it is a lot cleaner and easier to read.

- We‚Äôre using a SQLite database (via FastLite) to store our rooms.
- Each room has an id (integer), a name (string), and a created_at
  timestamp (string).
- The Room dataclass is automatically generated based on this structure.

2.  Creating a room

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
@rt("/")
def get():
    # The 'Input' id defaults to the same as the name, so you can omit it if you wish
    create_room = Form(Input(id="name", name="name", placeholder="New Room Name"),
                       Button("Create Room"),
                       hx_post="/rooms", hx_target="#rooms-list", hx_swap="afterbegin")
    rooms_list = Ul(*rooms(order_by='id DESC'), id='rooms-list')
    return Titled("DrawCollab", 
                  H1("DrawCollab"),
                  create_room, rooms_list)

@rt("/rooms")
async def post(room:Room):
    room.created_at = datetime.now().isoformat()
    return rooms.insert(room)
```

</div>

- When a user submits the ‚ÄúCreate Room‚Äù form, this route is called.
- It creates a new Room object, sets the creation time, and inserts it
  into the database.
- It returns an HTML list item with a link to the new room, which is
  dynamically added to the room list on the homepage thanks to HTMX.

3.  Let‚Äôs give our rooms shape

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
    room = rooms[id]
    return Titled(f"Room: {room.name}", H1(f"Welcome to {room.name}"), A(Button("Leave Room"), href="/"))
```

</div>

- This route renders the interface for a specific room.
- It fetches the room from the database and renders a title, heading,
  and paragraph.

Here is the full code so far:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
from datetime import datetime

def render(room):
    return Li(A(room.name, href=f"/rooms/{room.id}"))

app,rt,rooms,Room = fast_app('data/drawapp.db', render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, pk='id')

@rt("/")
def get():
    create_room = Form(Input(id="name", name="name", placeholder="New Room Name"),
                       Button("Create Room"),
                       hx_post="/rooms", hx_target="#rooms-list", hx_swap="afterbegin")
    rooms_list = Ul(*rooms(order_by='id DESC'), id='rooms-list')
    return Titled("DrawCollab", create_room, rooms_list)

@rt("/rooms")
async def post(room:Room):
    room.created_at = datetime.now().isoformat()
    return rooms.insert(room)

@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
    room = rooms[id]
    return Titled(f"Room: {room.name}", H1(f"Welcome to {room.name}"), A(Button("Leave Room"), href="/"))

serve()
```

</div>

Now run `python main.py` in your terminal and open your browser to the
‚ÄòLink‚Äô that appears. You should see a page with a form to create a new
room and a list of existing rooms.

#### The Canvas - Let‚Äôs Get Drawing! üñåÔ∏è

Time to add the actual drawing functionality. We‚Äôll use Fabric.js for
this:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
# ... (keep the previous imports and database setup)

@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
    room = rooms[id]
    canvas = Canvas(id="canvas", width="800", height="600")
    color_picker = Input(type="color", id="color-picker", value="#3CDD8C")
    brush_size = Input(type="range", id="brush-size", min="1", max="50", value="10")
    
    js = """
    var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');
    canvas.isDrawingMode = true;
    canvas.freeDrawingBrush.color = '#3CDD8C';
    canvas.freeDrawingBrush.width = 10;
    
    document.getElementById('color-picker').onchange = function() {
        canvas.freeDrawingBrush.color = this.value;
    };
    
    document.getElementById('brush-size').oninput = function() {
        canvas.freeDrawingBrush.width = parseInt(this.value, 10);
    };
    """
    
    return Titled(f"Room: {room.name}",
                  canvas,
                  Div(color_picker, brush_size),
                  Script(src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fabric.js/5.3.1/fabric.min.js"),
                  Script(js))

# ... (keep the serve() part)
```

</div>

Now we‚Äôve got a drawing canvas! FastHTML makes it easy to include
external libraries and add custom JavaScript.

#### Saving and Loading Canvases üíæ

Now that we have a working drawing canvas, let‚Äôs add the ability to save
and load drawings. We‚Äôll modify our database schema to include a
`canvas_data` field, and add new routes for saving and loading canvas
data. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll update our code:

1.  Modify the database schema:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
app,rt,rooms,Room = fast_app('data/drawapp.db', render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, canvas_data=str, pk='id')
```

</div>

2.  Add a save button that grabs the canvas‚Äô state and sends it to the
    server:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
    room = rooms[id]
    canvas = Canvas(id="canvas", width="800", height="600")
    color_picker = Input(type="color", id="color-picker", value="#3CDD8C")
    brush_size = Input(type="range", id="brush-size", min="1", max="50", value="10")
    save_button = Button("Save Canvas", id="save-canvas", hx_post=f"/rooms/{id}/save", hx_vals="js:{canvas_data: JSON.stringify(canvas.toJSON())}")
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

</div>

3.  Add routes for saving and loading canvas data:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
@rt("/rooms/{id}/save")
async def post(id:int, canvas_data:str):
    rooms.update({'canvas_data': canvas_data}, id)
    return "Canvas saved successfully"

@rt("/rooms/{id}/load")
async def get(id:int):
    room = rooms[id]
    return room.canvas_data if room.canvas_data else "{}"
```

</div>

4.  Update the JavaScript to load existing canvas data:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` javascript
js = f"""
    var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');
    canvas.isDrawingMode = true;
    canvas.freeDrawingBrush.color = '#3CDD8C';
    canvas.freeDrawingBrush.width = 10;
    // Load existing canvas data
    fetch(`/rooms/{id}/load`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {{
        if (data && Object.keys(data).length > 0) {{
            canvas.loadFromJSON(data, canvas.renderAll.bind(canvas));
        }}
    }});
    
    // ... (rest of the JavaScript remains the same)
"""
```

</div>

With these changes, users can now save their drawings and load them when
they return to the room. The canvas data is stored as a JSON string in
the database, allowing for easy serialization and deserialization. Try
it out! Create a new room, make a drawing, save it, and then reload the
page. You should see your drawing reappear, ready for further editing.

Here is the completed code:

<div class="code-with-filename">

**main.py**

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
from datetime import datetime

def render(room):
    return Li(A(room.name, href=f"/rooms/{room.id}"))

app,rt,rooms,Room = fast_app('data/drawapp.db', render=render, id=int, name=str, created_at=str, canvas_data=str, pk='id')

@rt("/")
def get():
    create_room = Form(Input(id="name", name="name", placeholder="New Room Name"),
                       Button("Create Room"),
                       hx_post="/rooms", hx_target="#rooms-list", hx_swap="afterbegin")
    rooms_list = Ul(*rooms(order_by='id DESC'), id='rooms-list')
    return Titled("QuickDraw", 
                  create_room, rooms_list)

@rt("/rooms")
async def post(room:Room):
    room.created_at = datetime.now().isoformat()
    return rooms.insert(room)

@rt("/rooms/{id}")
async def get(id:int):
    room = rooms[id]
    canvas = Canvas(id="canvas", width="800", height="600")
    color_picker = Input(type="color", id="color-picker", value="#000000")
    brush_size = Input(type="range", id="brush-size", min="1", max="50", value="10")
    save_button = Button("Save Canvas", id="save-canvas", hx_post=f"/rooms/{id}/save", hx_vals="js:{canvas_data: JSON.stringify(canvas.toJSON())}")

    js = f"""
    var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');
    canvas.isDrawingMode = true;
    canvas.freeDrawingBrush.color = '#000000';
    canvas.freeDrawingBrush.width = 10;

    // Load existing canvas data
    fetch(`/rooms/{id}/load`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {{
        if (data && Object.keys(data).length > 0) {{
            canvas.loadFromJSON(data, canvas.renderAll.bind(canvas));
        }}
    }});
    
    document.getElementById('color-picker').onchange = function() {{
        canvas.freeDrawingBrush.color = this.value;
    }};
    
    document.getElementById('brush-size').oninput = function() {{
        canvas.freeDrawingBrush.width = parseInt(this.value, 10);
    }};
    """
    
    return Titled(f"Room: {room.name}",
                  A(Button("Leave Room"), href="/"),
                  canvas,
                  Div(color_picker, brush_size, save_button),
                  Script(src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fabric.js/5.3.1/fabric.min.js"),
                  Script(js))

@rt("/rooms/{id}/save")
async def post(id:int, canvas_data:str):
    rooms.update({'canvas_data': canvas_data}, id)
    return "Canvas saved successfully"

@rt("/rooms/{id}/load")
async def get(id:int):
    room = rooms[id]
    return room.canvas_data if room.canvas_data else "{}"

serve()
```

### Deploying to Railway

You can deploy your website to a number of hosting providers, for this
tutorial we‚Äôll be using Railway. To get started, make sure you create an
[account](https://railway.app/) and install the [Railway
CLI](https://docs.railway.app/guides/cli). Once installed, make sure to
run `railway login` to log in to your account.

To make deploying your website as easy as possible, FastHTMl comes with
a built in CLI tool that will handle most of the deployment process for
you. To deploy your website, run the following command in your terminal
in the root directory of your project:

``` sh
fh_railway_deploy quickdraw
```

<div>

> **Note**
>
> Your app must be located in a `main.py` file for this to work.

</div>

### Conclusion: You‚Äôre a FastHTML Artist Now! üé®üöÄ

Congratulations! You‚Äôve just built a sleek, interactive web application
using FastHTML. Let‚Äôs recap what we‚Äôve learned:

1.  FastHTML allows you to create dynamic web apps with minimal code.
2.  We used FastHTML‚Äôs routing system to handle different pages and
    actions.
3.  We integrated with a SQLite database to store room information and
    canvas data.
4.  We utilized Fabric.js to create an interactive drawing canvas.
5.  We implemented features like color picking, brush size adjustment,
    and canvas saving.
6.  We used HTMX for seamless, partial page updates without full
    reloads.
7.  We learned how to deploy our FastHTML application to Railway for
    easy hosting.

You‚Äôve taken your first steps into the world of FastHTML development.
From here, the possibilities are endless! You could enhance the drawing
app further by adding features like:

- Implementing different drawing tools (e.g., shapes, text)
- Adding user authentication
- Creating a gallery of saved drawings
- Implementing real-time collaborative drawing using WebSockets

Whatever you choose to build next, FastHTML has got your back. Now go
forth and create something awesome! Happy coding! üñºÔ∏èüöÄ
